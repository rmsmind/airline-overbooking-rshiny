## Task 1

\( Y_i \) is an independent and identically distributed (iid) Bernoulli random variable representing whether a person with a ticket shows up for the flight:

\[
Y_i \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \text{Ber}(p)
\]

\[
Y_i =
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if the person shows up} \\ 
0, & \text{if the person does not show up}
\end{cases}
\]

\( p \) is the probability that a ticketed passenger shows up:

\[
P(Y_i = 1) = p.
\]

\( S \) is the total number of ticketed passengers who show up for the flight:

\[
S = Y_1 + Y_2 + \dots + Y_n
\]

Therefore, \( S \) follows a Binomial distribution, where \( n \) is the total number of tickets sold and \( p \) is the probability that a ticketed passenger shows up:

\[
S \sim \text{Bin}(n, p)
\]

\(\gamma\) is the probability that a flight is overbooked, where \( N \) is the number of available seats:

\[
\gamma = P(S > N)
\]

## Task 2
By rearranging the probability equation: 

\[
1 - \gamma = P(S \leq N) = \text{pbinom}(N, n, p)
\]

The objective function \( f(n) \) is defined:

\[
f(n) = 1 - \gamma - \text{pbinom}(N, n, p) = 0
\]

The objective function \( f(n) \) helps determine the optimal \( n \) number of tickers that should be sold, while maintaining a desired probability of overbooking. The goal is to find the root of \( f(n) \) that corresponds to the optimal \( n \).

## Task 3
```{r}
# Airline overbooking problem parameters
N <- 200      # Number of seats on the flight
p <- 0.95     # Probability that a ticket holder shows up
gamma <- 0.20 # Probability of overbooking

# Range of possible ticket sales (n values)
nposs <- seq(N, N + 20, by = 1) 

# Compute objective function f(n)
fn_values <- 1 - gamma - pbinom(N, size = nposs, prob = p)

# Find the optimal n where f(n) is minimized (root of f(n)) - index
n_optimal <- nposs[which.min(abs(fn_values))]

# Print result
print(n_optimal)

# Plot: Objective function (Discrete)
plot(nposs, fn_values, type = "p", pch = 16, col = "blue",
     xlab = "n", 
     ylab = "Objective",
     main = paste("Objective Vs n to find optimal tickets sold \n (", n_optimal, ") gamma=", gamma, "N=", N, "discrete"))

# Blue dots for f(n) >= 0 (positive values)
points(nposs[fn_values >= 0], fn_values[fn_values >= 0], pch = 16, col = "blue")

# Red dots representing |f(n)| (negative values)
points(nposs[fn_values < 0], abs(fn_values[fn_values < 0]), pch = 16, col = "red")

# Connecting lines for blue dots (positive values)
lines(nposs, fn_values, col = "black", lty = 2)

# Reference lines
abline(h = 0, col = "red", lwd = 2)
abline(v = n_optimal, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

## Task 4
\[
\text{Normal Approximation:}
\]

\[
\text{Mean: } \mu_n = np
\]

\[
\text{Standard Deviation: } \sigma_n = \sqrt{np(1 - p)}
\]

\[
\text{Variance: } \sigma_n^2 = np(1 - p)
\]

\[
S \approx N(np, np(1 - p))
\]
